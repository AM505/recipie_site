### Defensive Programming

I have used defensive programming through my app to ensure that users who are not logged in, or users who did not create the opportunities or categories are unable to edit. This is achieved by checking whether there is a user in session, and then also checking to see if the session user is the same user who created the opportunity. Had I more time I would have liked to have developed a custom 404 pages that would direct users back to the home page, should any errors occur whilst they are using the app.

I have made use of modals to provide helpful warnings to the admin if records are to be deleted, double check that the admin definately wanted to do this.

## Deployment

The site was deployed to Heroku. Please follow the below steps.
Deployment steps

- add the list of requirements by writing in the terminal "pip3 freeze > requirements.txt"

- in this new window - click Python and "Save changes"
- click "Add build pack" again

- take care to have those apps in this order: Python first, Node.js second, drag and drop if needed
- Next go to "Deploy" in the menu bar on the top
- Go to section "deployment method", choose "GitHub"
